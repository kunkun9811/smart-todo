| action-creators | This directory contains all the **action creators** for all of the reducer created. All of these **action creators** are then all exported in one single file for code readability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| action-types    | This directory contains all the **action types** used by all the **action creators** to signal what kind of **action** it is sending and used by all the **reducers** to check which action they have received.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| actions         | This directory contains all the **actions** for each of the reducer. You can think of **actions** as the template used by **action creators** to populate the correct data and data types then send to corresponding **reducers**. Do not confuse this with **action-types**. **actions** contains the actual templates that are used to be filled and sent to **reducers**. It specifies the **type** and **payload** variables types. You can think of email templates where it has _subject_, _from_, _to_, etc. On the other hand, **action-types** has all the, well, types. It is used in filling the **type** property for **action creators** and used by **reducers** to validate the action type. |
| reducers        | This directory contains all the **reducers** for this project. They are then all exported in one file in **index.ts**. Reducers are like people in the front desk. They check what **type** of action the received and use it to create and return new **state** for the corresponding value in the store                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
