These files contain all the different kinds of **ACTIONS** that exist in each of the slice design. Take real life exapmles, these files are like the manual of all the actions each **slice** has. Like cars you can brake, accelerate, ...etc.

**These files are NOT essential, they are only used for _CODE READABILITY_ and _CLEANESS_**
